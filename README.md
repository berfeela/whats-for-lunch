Tying out RoR in 2024. v7.2.2

Get a random dish to make and eat for when you're confused about what you should have.

Go to ...app/controllers/recipes_controller.rb and replace with your favourite dishes.
Upon clicking 'Find Out' the app will randomly return a dish from your list.

It won't repeat the last three results you got.
